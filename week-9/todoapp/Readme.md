### **Full-Stack Todo App: TypeScript + React + Recoil (Frontend) & TypeScript + Express (Backend)**

 A full-stack Todo app with TypeScript on both the frontend (React + Recoil) and backend (Express) . Here's a detailed plan that covers both the frontend and backend.

#### **Project Overview**:

-   **Frontend (React + Recoil + TypeScript)**: The user will interact with a UI that allows them to create, update, delete, and filter todos. The frontend will communicate with the backend through API calls.
-   **Backend (Express + TypeScript)**: The backend will provide RESTful API routes to manage todos. It will store todos in a Postgresql Database
